## Instructions

This is a simple Frogger game that let's you control a character. The goal is to move the character across the street and to reach the water without getting hit by the bugs. Each time the character reaches the water the speed of the moving bugs will increase proportionally.

## About

This is my attempt at the Frogger Arcade Game assignment by Udacity.
I edited the code until it met all the criteria as stated in the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric). 

## Contributing

This is forked from the Udacity course, it is a finished assignment.
